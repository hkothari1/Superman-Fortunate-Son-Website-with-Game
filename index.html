        <h3> Metropolis is being riddled with a hazardous storm of kryptonite and only one being has the capacity to rebel against the odds put forth before him. THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB FOR SUPERMAN!</h3>
        Survive the onslaught and reach a score of 6500 in order to save Metropolis, otherwise it will perish! Superman will take damage only if struck on the head for kryptonite is his only weakness!!
